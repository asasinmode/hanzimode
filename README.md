# hanzimode

This is a small website to help with learning chinese hànzì.

To use, download the `index.html` and `index.js` files, then open the `index.html` file in your browser (make sure both files are located in the same directory).

## functionality

Start by adding the hànzì, its pinyin and meaning and optionally a note.

> [!WARNING]
> Your data will be saved locally in the browser storage, but it may be cleared because of external factors. I recommend using the **export data** button to backup your hànzì or share it between devices with **import data**.

Once you've made a collection hànzì you're familiar with, use the **start loop** button to

0. save/load data
1. import/export functionality
2. choose which type to show: hanzi/pinyin/meaning.
   - toogle mode choose options (3/5?) or type. hanzi only choose option. add noise hanzi?
   - pinyin diacritic helpers
   - some button/hover to reveal one of other 2
   - display note somewhere
   - notifications (save/loaded) & errors somewhere
3. start loop
4. reset loop
5. store loop info
6. display X/Y hanzi progressed through/stored
